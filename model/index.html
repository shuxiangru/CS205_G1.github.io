	<h1>Data Description</h1>
	<p> We found three 16x16 and three 25x25 Sudoku puzzles with different difficulty levels 
		to test our software and compute speedup. All the problem are found on line. We
		manually take out a few cells from the solution board to adjust problem difficulty.</p>

			<ul >
			  <li>Serially generate a list of incomplete solutions through bootstrapping:
				fill a few empty cells with all possible values, and generate a shared deque of
				possible board to be solved by each thread</li>
			  <li>Each thread solve the boards in parallel with the backtracking algorithm</li>
			  <li>Use dynamic scheduling to balance work load on all threads: each thread
				will pop a new board from the deque to solve when it finished solving the previous board</li>
			</ul>

			<img src="/CS205_G1.github.io/img/mpi_omp.png" alt="mpi+omp" width="600">

			<ul>
			  <li>Serially generate a list of incomplete solutions </li>
			  <li>Evenly dispatch the list of borads to nodes</li>
				<ul >
					<li>Each node generates a list of incomplete solutions using 
						the same method as the OpenMP version</li>
					<li>Each node performs OMP-level parallelism to solve the puzzle</li>
				</ul>
			  <li>All nodes output the solutions to a queue of solutions to be gathered and 
				  printed out by the master node </li>
			</ul>
	
	        <p class="subtitle">Advanced Feature</p>
	                <ul>
				<li>Random shuffle: shuffle the deque of boards before dispatching to each
					node. This will make sure that the work load of each node is relatively
					balanced, and no node waits a long time for other nodes to finish.</li>
				<li>MPI Dynamic Scheduling</li>
	                </ul>
