					 <p>
						 Sudoku is a combinatorial number placement puzzle. The objective of this game is to fill a 9×9 grid (board) with digits 
						 so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids (boxes) contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. 
						 Higher-rank sudokus usually have n^2*n^2 board with n*n boxes (n>3). However, higher-rank sudokus take hours to run in serial. 
						 Thus, we aim to parallelize a sudoku solver algorithm with several parallelization techniques (OpenMP and MPI), 
						 so that giant sudoku solver can be solved within a limited time.
